# Image Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple deep learning model for image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset using PyTorch. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The project includes data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
